                   <p class="intro">
       Hi, I'm Archanaben Prajapati, a recent graduate in Data Science from the University of Salford. My passion lies in transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive decision-making. Through my academic journey, I’ve developed strong analytical, problem-solving, and data visualization skills, using tools such as Python, SQL, R and Power BI.
       
       I enjoy tackling real-world problems with data and continuously expanding my knowledge in machine learning and statistical analysis. In addition to my technical expertise, I’m a strong collaborator and communicator, always eager to explore innovative solutions and share insights with others.
       
       When I’m not diving into datasets, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading about the latest trends in AI, or enjoying a good hike outdoors.</p>
